# moodometer

## Currently in development

A tracker for your mood & journal built in react-native.
Idea is to be able to log your mood, and add an optional note as a kind of diary.

Will then have options to view mood over time, and view, edit and delete your notes.


Inspired by my fitbit app's partial implementation of the basic logging mood, but adding a text field and not having that annoying banner that asks you to buy premium for 'more insight'.

Progress:

✅ starting template for entering submissions.\
✅ Navigation banner \
✅ decided whether or not to save data to cloud or local storage\
⚠️ Using Async Storage\
Online DB, while a good challenge, poses the need to introduce a login management system - outside the scope of this project (may revisit in future)
      
🚧➡️ Saving data\
❌ Reading saved data\
❌ History tab\
❌ Notes tab\
❌ polish\
