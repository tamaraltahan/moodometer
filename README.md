# moodometer

## Currently in development

A tracker for your mood & journal built in react-native.
Idea is to be able to log your mood, and add an optional note as a kind of diary.

Will then have options to view mood over time, and view, edit and delete your notes.


Inspired by my fitbit app's partial implementation of the basic mood logging, but adding a text field and not having that annoying banner that asks you to buy premium for 'more insight'.

Progress:

✅ starting template for entering submissions.\
✅ Navigation banner \
✅ decided whether or not to save data to cloud or local storage\
✅ OAuth\
✅ Saving data\

Next step is to implement the history tab.
I'm aiming to display an average mood, and a chart of mood over time 

A feature I would like to add but may need some backend support is to be able to segment scores between weeks and months.

The history tab should pull db data of submissions, plot scores, & show avg to begin.
